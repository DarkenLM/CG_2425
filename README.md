# CG-2425 - Mini Scene Graph Based 3D Engine

## Development
1. Run `./setup.sh` to setup the project.
2. Run `./build.sh` to build the entire project.
3. Run `./run.sh engine` and `./run.sh generator` to execute the built `engine` or `generator` executables.

- Use the `DEBUG_MODE` comptime define to determine whether the project is in debug mode.
- Use `./clean.sh` to remove the build artifacts. Use `./clean.sh --all` to nuke the whole build directory.

If CMake stops working, god help you, because I sure as fuck won't.
